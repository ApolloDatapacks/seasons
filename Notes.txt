Design notes:
- Vanilla-like updates
  - The world changes at random and around the player
  - The player should be in control of changing the world

TODO:
- Crops being affected by seasons
- Faster transition if further away from "right" season (skip?)
- All the biomes!
- All the plants!
- lily pads vs ice?
- Savanna: raining in summer, dry in winter
- Snow for fall/spring in mountain biomes
- Swamp grass splotching is hardcoded. Could probably try to mirror based on coordinates and several biomes? Worth it?

Research notes:
- Diff between beach & snowy beach: -.1 downfall, -0.75 temperature
- Diff between taiga & snowy taiga: -.4 downfall, -0.75 temperature
- Diff between plains & snowy plains: +.1 downfall, -0.8 temperature
- Downfall: only used for internal calculations of grass/foliage color
- Temperature cutoff for rain/snow: 0.15
- Snow golems die temperature: 1.0
- Above height 80, temperature is lowered by this amount: (noise*8 + y - 80) * 0.00125

Conclusions:
- "Vanilla winter" is .75 colder than summer
- A vanilla winter biome in summer is not warm enough for snow golems to melt (good)
- Snow can still exist in high altitude locations in rainy biomes
  - should probably try to use this for snow arriving early on mountains
  - Need to not melt snow in those locations!
    - Idea: figure out bounds of formula above, use them for snowing in plants and melting stuff
