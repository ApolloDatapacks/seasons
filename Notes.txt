Design notes:
- Vanilla-like updates
  - The world changes at random and around the player
  - The player should be in control of changing the world

TODO:
- Fix melt in summer making spring biomes
- Fall not melting snow?
- Hide grass / plants under snow?
- Crops being affected by seasons
- Faster transition if further away from "right" season
- Does ice melt in warm biomes?
