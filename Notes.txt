Design notes:
- Vanilla-like updates
  - The world changes at random and around the player
  - The player should be in control of changing the world

TODO:
- Add winter-like biome for spring that has rain instead of snow
- Only replace biome once snow is all melted
- Melt snow quicker (run more random samples per tick)
